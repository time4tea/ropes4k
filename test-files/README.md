# Test files for performance tests

These are the original files (or similar) that were used in the original performance tests.

These versions are from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org) and believed to be free to distribute.

They have been converted from utf-8 to ascii using

```
iconv -c -f utf-8 -t ASCII//IGNORE <orig> -o <recoded>
```

as the original performance tests don't (seem) to work with multi-byte characters.
